Some documentation to-dos:

  - Explain relationship between "TEI document" and "instance"
  
  - Explain paragraph inference (likely w/ change to guidelines doc)
  
  - Implementation details for #lang ricoeur/tei/kernel
    have not been reviewed beyond getting the document to compile
    and build w/o warnings.
    Need to update/correct what's there and check completeness.
    
  - Add implementation details for TEI Lint.
  
  - See if it is feasable to make doc-coverage part of the automated
    test suite.
