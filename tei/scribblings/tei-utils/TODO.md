Some documentation to-dos:

  - Explain paragraph inference (likely w/ change to guidelines doc)
  
  - Implementation details for #lang ricoeur/tei/kernel
    do not currently cover the bindings re-exported by the language.
    
  - Add implementation details for TEI Lint.
  
  - See if it is feasable to make doc-coverage part of the automated
    test suite.
