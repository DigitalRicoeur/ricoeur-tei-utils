Digital Ricoeur TEI Schema
==========================

The files in this directory relate to the schema defining the custom
subset of TEI used by Digital Ricoeur. They are generated using the
[Roma](http://www.tei-c.org/Roma) web application.

The `DR-TEI.xml` file contains the customization saved from Roma.
The other files (except this file) are derived from it.

The `DR-TEI.dtd` file is the actual Document Type Definition
referenced by our TEI XML files.
The `DR-TEI.rng` file is the equivalent RelaxNG schema.

The `DR-TEI_doc.html` file is the HTML documentation generated by Roma.
The `DR-TEI_doc.xml` file is the same documentation in TEI's XML format
